# Library Pro
This is my application to get information about Library books via a QR code.
I worked on it in 2015/16 for a school project, since then development has completely stopped. If i decide to get back into andriod programming then I plan to change anything that is static to completely dynamic and get it working with a database of books and hopefully implement it in a small setting to get feedback.

See the evidence folder for screenshots and a video of the program in use.
